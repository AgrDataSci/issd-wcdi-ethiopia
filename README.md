### Highlights
- Central planning in Ethiopia’s formal seed systems limits participation of non-state actors
- Breeders and seed producers have insufficient ways of knowing what farmers want
- A citizen science effort conducted on-farm variety trials with 29,523 smallholders
- We test four hypotheses regarding sex-disaggregated trait preferences of 361 varieties of 12 crops
- We position citizen science as an approach to integrated seed sector development

### Abstract

**Context:** Ethiopia’s diverse agroecology and agronomy include a vast portfolio of crops. Plant breeding, agricultural extension, and the seed sector are centrally planned for major food security crops. This limits non-state actors’ participation and results in a limited understanding of farmers’ preferred crops and varieties.

**Objective:** We contest prevailing assumptions in Ethiopia’s formal seed systems about farmers’ varietal preferences, through four hypotheses: 1. Men and women smallholders’ varietal and trait preferences do not differ significantly; 2. Yield is the strongest trait driving farmers’ varietal preference; 3. Farmers prefer newly released varieties; and 4. Farmers prefer superiority over diversity.

**Methods:** We conducted sex-balanced citizen science on-farm variety selection trials among 29,523 smallholders across a wide range of agro-ecologies. We applied a tricot (triadic comparison of technology) experimental design, whereby each participating farmer received small packages of three randomly assigned varieties from at least 361 varieties of 12 different species of cereals, pulses, and oilseeds to assess under their own management practices. Farmer-preferred traits were measured at agreed times and uploaded to the ClimMob.net platform. The Plackett-Luce model estimated the probability of one variety outperforming the others and ranked trait preferences 

**Results and conclusions:** The study indicates dissimilar patterns in men’s and women’s different crop trait preferences. Yield is the strongest driver of overall preference, but adaptability and marketability traits also rank highly. Recently released varieties are favored over older ones―with exceptions. Few individual varieties were outright winners, indicating that farmers prefer a portfolio of options. Nevertheless, the study reveals certain varieties that suppliers are least likely to regret including in their portfolios.
